        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        
        <p>Welcome to the Dynamic Environments and Meaning Change Lab. We study the impact of informational environments 
            on the ways that people think about and interact with each other. Projects that members of the DEMC Lab explore 
            the link between "macro-level" structural conditions (i.e., network environments, institutional contexts, and informational 
            settings) and "micro-level" cognitive/social psychological phenomena (e.g., mental representations).</p>
            
            <p>While DEMC Lab projects vary in scope, they are often unified by three central questions:</p>
        
        <ol>
        <li>How do macro-level social environments - and changes to these environments - impact the meanings that
            individuals have about objects or behaviors they observe in the world around them? </li>
        <li>When might social environments produce durable changes to features of social cognition, or how people make sense
            of and interact with people, objects, and situations they encounter?</li>
        <li>Can systematic changes in micro-level cultural meaning lead to changes in macro-level social structure?</li>
        </ol>

        <p>By asking and exploring answers to these questions, the work of the DEMC Lab aims to build knowledge about the impact of 
           social structures on invidual-level beliefs and behaviors and vice versa. We aspire to ask rigorous basic science questions 
           with implications for understanding the levers related to important social issues like gender discrimination, racial 
           segregation, political polarization, and identity-based stigma.</p>
