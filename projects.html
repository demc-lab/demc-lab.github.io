                <h4>Can culture evolve through "unsettled times?"</h4>
                <div class="project-text">
                    <p>
                      Can large-scale environmental disruptions create cultural belief change? While prevailing models of cultural change emphasize 
                        the stability of beliefs in adults, we propose that durable belief change can occur when major events transform a society’s 
                        material or cultural environment in ways that make specific stimuli unexpectedly salient. Like certain occupations during
                        the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown period.

                <h4>Simulating active search in networks</h4>
                <div class="project-text">
                    <p>
                      Networks impact how we acquire information and adopt behaviors. Current models of these processes highlight the influence of 
                        social structures on person- and system-level outcomes, but in doing so they do so by reducing the people within them to 
                        cultural dupes who are "infected" only by passive contact or peer pressure. By contrast, actors often actively and 
                        strategically seek out ideas or practices they may adopt in ways that are patterned by their social networks. We're
                        elaborating this argument through a set of agent-based network models that augment existing approaches with active search
                        routines inspired by network theory and cognitive science.

                <h4>Can working from home reduce the motherhood penalty?</h4>
                <div class="project-text">
                    <p>
                      Mothers who work are paid and promoted less, hired less often, and viewed as less competent and committed to their 
                        organizations compared to women who are not mothers. One one well-identified cause of this "motherhood penalty" is 
                        discrimination against mothers. While researchers who study the penalty often explain it to be the result of conflicting
                        cultural meanings that underpin the roles of “mothers” and “workers” in society, but these schemas have not yet been clearly
                        measured or linked directly to the motherhood penalty. We are working on a project that measures these schemas, and
                        examines whether recently popularized remote work opportunities can reduce the motherhood penalty by reducing role conflict.
